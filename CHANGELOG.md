# Timeline of PMGH

-   **PIXI Ages**: `9/21/19 - 3/25/20`
-   -   During these times, `PIXI.game` was a thing. However, Prodigy hacks were not well known.
-   **Phaser Day**: `3/25/20 - 3/26/20`
-   -   On this day, we used `Phaser.GAMES[0]`, only for it to be patched the day after.
-   **Login.gameObj** Day: `3/26/20 - 3/27/20`
-   -   An alternative method was found. However, it only supported the player object. It was also patched after a day.
-   **CanvasPool Days**: `3/27/20 - 3/30/20`
-   -   This method worked for longer. However, it was also quickly patched.
-   **Cheat Dashboard Day**: `3/30/20 - 3/30/20`
-   -   A cheat dashboard was developed. However, it was not very good, which caused it to be unsupported the day after.
-   **Dark Ages**: `4/01/20 - 4/07/20`
-   -   The first week of April was a sad week for Prodigy hacking. All known hacking methods were patched.
-   **EnableDebug Breakthrough**: `4/07/20 - 4/09/20`
-   -   A way to enable debug mode was found, and worked for two days. However, debug was removed by Prodigy quickly after.
-   **Prodigy Console Prevention**: `4/10/20`
-   -   On this day, prodigy added the devtool disabler, which would cause a 404 on devtool open.
-   **Debugger Scope Ages**: `4/12/20 - 4/15`
-   -   On these days, multiple variables were used to obtain the prodigy's scopes, and access the `instance` objects.
-   **Redirector Ages**: `4/15/20 - CURRENT`
-   -   After many days, the redirector hack was created, which would use a modified version of prodigy's game files. This would not be patched for a very long time. It is still working well.
-   **Content Security Patch**: `6/10/20 - CURRENT`
-   -   On June 10th, Prodigy added content security headers. This caused the addition of another extension to help with hacks.
- **`hack.instance.prodigy.player` Patch**: `7/5/20 - 7/5/20`
-   -   On July 5th, Prodigy implemented a patch for `hack.instance.prodigy.player`. This was unpatched by ProdigyMathGameHacking about 3 hours later.
-  **Script based hacks return**: `8/25/20 - CURRENT`
-   - On August 20th, we found a way to access the Prodigy network, and make hacks without the redirector extension.
- **`_.instance.prodigy.player` Patch**: `9/17 - CURRENT`
-   - On September 18th, Prodigy patched the `hack` variable by redirecting to a 404 page if the `hack` variable was there. To unpatch this, we made the variable `_`, which Prodigy already uses, so they can't delete it.
