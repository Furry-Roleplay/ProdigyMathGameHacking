# ProdigyMathGameHacking

## Motivation
We are not trying to ruin Prodigy Math Game; we want to fix it. However, Prodigy has ignored all of our security reports, and has gone as far as to block a user from their Zendesk support center, simply because they reported hacks. We created this repository to show them the security issues directly.

This may look like we're trying to ruin the game, but we're improving the security of the game. By constantly finding and reporting hacks, we can help Prodigy become secure!
Hacking games for the greater good!

All of our hacks are open source, and free. No paywalls, no ads, and no Patreon. If you really want to support us, you can Nitro boost our Discord server!

## Disclaimer
While our hacks are completely safe, ***you should only use hacks on an alternate account***.

There's a **very small chance your account will be hacker-tagged, or banned**. Fortunately, it almost never happens.

We will **never** ask you for your password. If somebody asks you for personal/sensitive information, report it to the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/XQDfbfq) admins. 

All of our hacks are *open-source, and only located under our [Github Organization](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking)*.
If it's not an official repository, or a fork, it may not be safe!

Furthermore:

- All hacks, exploits, or other files hosted here may damage your account if used improperly or excessively. Do not use *any* of these hacks on your primary account, as you risk your account becoming damaged beyond repair, preventing you from accessing Prodigy Math Game in that account. You have been warned.

This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such partyâ€™s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
